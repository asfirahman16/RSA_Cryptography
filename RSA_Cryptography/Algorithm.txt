RSA-Cryptography Algorithm:

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorith used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt message.
It is an asymmetric cryptographic algotithm.This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone.
The other key must be kept private.The Required algotrith for Encrypting a message using RSA Cryptography is described below:

1. choose two different prime number "p" and "q".
2. Calculate "N" = p*q.
3. calculate Q(N)=(p-1)(q-1).
4. Choose an integer "e", such that 1 < e < Q(N), and co-prime with both N and Q(N).
5. compute "d", where "de" congruent to [1 mod Q(N)].

Now,For encrypting use encrypting key(N,E); p2 = p1^e mod N, where 'p1' is the ASCII value of the letter in the secret message.

And For decrypting use decrypting key(N,d), p1 = p2^d mod N, where 'p2' is the ASCII value of the letter in the encrypted message.
